        <h2>Introduction :</h2>
        <p>As the name implies, food waste is when edible food is thrown away, lost, or left uneaten while it is still valid for consumption. It includes many forms of waste such as food that is intentionally thrown away, expired food, kitchen trimmings, etc.
            Significant amounts of food waste are generated in different stages including the primary production, distribution, and sale of food products, and the preparation and serving of food in commercial and domestic environments.
            Every year, approximately 1.3 billion tons of food, which accounts for around one-third of global food production, is lost or wasted. Among this high amount, one-third occurs during the production phase. This wasted food is valued at around U.S. $1 trillion.
            Developing countries and industrialized areas have high levels of food losses which mainly occur in initial agricultural production. There are many causes of this, including poor agriculture and natural resource management, and very often unfavorable climate conditions. In fact, this is not a problem only for developing countries but for other countries as well.
        </p>
        
        
        <h2>Sustainable Campus :</h2>
        <p><b>Lovely Professional University</b> recognizes the importance of sustainable and integrated waste management in lowering its environmental footprint and ensuring a safe and healthy work environment for the employees and students. In order to achieve this University ensures that wastes generated due to various farm- and lab operations, use of different laboratory chemicals, insecticides, fungicides, weedicides and experimental organisms, clinical facilities, cleaning operations etc. are disposed in appropriate manner and as per respective government guidelines wherever applicable and if possible, converting it into value added environment friendly product.</p>
        <h2>Scope :</h2><br>
        <p>The framework covers management of all the different type of waste hazardous or non hazardous covering any item biological, chemical, physical and radiological which has the potential of causing harm to humans, animals or environment. The collection, disposal and recycle of the waste should be done as per the guidelines laid by the respective government bodies. The framework is extended to all the contracted services on the campus including food catering services, canteens, suppliers of stationary, equipment and building contracts and supply chain.
            Waste minimization, Reuse and Recycling In order to successfully implement waste management waste avoidance and minimization at source is very important and should be a continual process. • Training and workshops are conducted at regular intervals for creating awareness. • Vermicomposting is done to produce compost from the waste leaf litter and various species of earthworms. Composting pit can is supplemented with cooked and raw kitchen waste being produced from various hostel messes. The compost produced is be used to supply nutrients to plantation in the University. • The bins of left over foods are transported to nearby piggeries and cow sheds to fed to animals.</p>

        <h1>Impact on Sustainable Development Goals: </h1>
        <p>Food waste reduction contributes significantly to several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined by the United Nations. Here are some ways in which reducing food waste aligns with key SDGs:<br>

            <b><i>Zero Hunger (SDG 2):</b></i> By reducing food waste, more food becomes available for consumption, contributing directly to the goal of ending hunger. It helps ensure that the food produced is utilized efficiently and reaches those in need.<br>
            
            <b><i>Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12):</b></i> Food waste reduction is closely tied to responsible consumption and production. It encourages sustainable practices in the food supply chain, from production to consumption, minimizing the environmental impact associated with wasted resources.<br>
            
            <b><i>Climate Action (SDG 13):</b></i> Food waste generates greenhouse gas emissions when it decomposes in landfills. By reducing food waste, fewer resources are used in food production, leading to lower emissions and contributing to efforts to mitigate climate change.<br>
            
            <b><i>Life Below Water (SDG 14) and Life on Land (SDG 15):</b></i> The production and disposal of food contribute to biodiversity loss and environmental degradation. Reducing food waste helps preserve ecosystems and reduces the pressure on both marine and terrestrial environments.<br>
            
           <b><i> Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3):</b></i> Efficient food usage and reduced food waste contribute to better nutrition and health outcomes. When food is wasted, not only are resources lost, but the nutritional value of the food is also not realized, impacting overall health.<br>
            
            <b><i>Poverty Reduction (SDG 1):</b></i> Efficient use of food resources and reduced waste can contribute to poverty reduction by ensuring that more food reaches markets and communities. This can positively impact the livelihoods of those involved in the food supply chain.<br>
            
            <b><i>Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 6):</b></i> Food production requires water, and wasted food represents a loss of water resources. By reducing food waste, water resources are used more efficiently, contributing to the goal of clean water and sanitation.<br>
            
            <b><i>Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17):</b></i> Addressing food waste requires collaboration across sectors, including government, businesses, and communities. Partnerships are crucial to developing and implementing effective strategies to reduce food waste.
            Efforts to reduce food waste involve interventions at various stages of the food supply chain, including production, transportation, storage, and consumption. These efforts often involve raising awareness, improving infrastructure, implementing better storage and transportation practices, and encouraging responsible consumer behavior.
            Overall, reducing food waste is a multifaceted approach that positively impacts multiple SDGs, contributing to a more sustainable and equitable global future.</p>

        <h2>Suggested Steps to reduce food waste</h2>
        <p><b><i>Conducting a Food Waste Audit:</i></b><br>
            The initial phase involves working closely with cafeteria management, student organizations, and local businesses to conduct a comprehensive food waste audit. By collecting data on the types and amounts of food waste generated, we can identify key areas for intervention.
             <br><b><i>Awareness and Training:</i></b><br>
            Educational materials, including posters, brochures, and digital content, will be created to inform the campus community about the environmental impact of food waste and provide practical tips for waste reduction.
           <br> <b><i>Donation and Redistribution Programs:</i></b><br>
            Building connections with charities will enable the establishment of a system for the safe and legal donation of edible food.
            <br><b><i>Continuous Improvement and Monitoring :</i></b><br>
            Regular reviews and analyses of data from waste tracking systems will be conducted to identify trends and areas for improvement. Adjustments to the initiative will be made based on feedback and changing circumstances.
            <br><b><i>Evaluating Impact:</i></b><br>
            An impact assessment will be conducted to evaluate the success of the project in reducing food waste. Feedback will be collected from students, cafeteria staff, and other stakeholders to inform future initiatives.
            <br><b><i>Documenting Best Practices:</i></b><br>
            A comprehensive report detailing successful strategies, challenges faced, and key learnings will be compiled. This report will serve as
            a guide for future initiatives and will be shared with campus authorities and other educational institutions.
            <br><b><i>Establishing Sustainability:</i></b><br>

        <h2>Food Waste Management and ISO Standards:</h2>
        <img src="https://www.taxreturnwala.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ISO-Logo-300x110.png" alt="Image 2">
        <p><b>International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</b> has developed numerous standards which help organizations address food waste and promote sustainable practices in the food industry.
            One of the key ISO standards related to food waste management is ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems (EMS).
            ISO 14001  provides a framework for organizations to establish and maintain an Environmental Management System (EMS) and it helps them manage their environmental impact, improve sustainability, and comply with environmental regulations.
            ISO 22000 is another standard of high importance that focuses on food safety management systems. Even though it does not directly address food waste, implementing ISO 22000 can indirectly contribute to reducing food waste by improving processes and minimizing risks that can lead to waste generation. Furthermore, ISO 22000 can help address other food waste aspects such as traceability, shelf-life management, and supplier control. 
            In addition, other ISO standards, such as the management ones; ISO 9001 Quality Management System and ISO 50001 Energy Management System, can also help organizations optimize their processes, reduce waste, and enhance their performance.
